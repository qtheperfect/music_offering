# Music Offering: 
  An instrumental C++ program to show music key switches.
# Brief Introduction: 
   This script helps to learn how music keys are shifted by the sharp & flat marks in sheet music. 
   You can control the shifts by adding p(sharp) or l(flat) notes, and check how the (logical) black & white keys are arranged on the piano. 
# Example:
   Try the following commands in console, and the logical pianos will be printed after RET (RET means Enter):
   - type C RET to switch to C-Major;
   - type p RET to sharpen to G-Major, or l RET to flatten to F-Major;
   - type F or Eb or G# to switch to each corresponding majors;
   - type C to go back to C-Major;
   - type ppppp RET to check that five sharp marks result in B-Major;
   - type C RET llll RET to check that four flat marks result in G#(Ab)-Major;
   - type s to toggle the #/b marks of the piano, or q to quit.
